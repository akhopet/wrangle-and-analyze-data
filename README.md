i used python programming language to  gather, access, clean and visualize a dataset
The WeRateDogs tweets dataset contained names, ratings of dogs etc. as well as favorite counts and retweet counts of each of the tweets. As with any data, we want to gain insights by asking questions based on the data. For example, we may pose questions like “What are the popular dog names?” or “Which tweet had the highest rating?” etc. Analysis of the data produced the following insights: 
• The average dog rating numerator was 13.3. 
• The most popular dog name found in the dataset were Lucy and Charlie. 
• The higher the rating, the higher the favorite counts.
